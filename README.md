# Cloud-Drills

I participated in a Cloud Engineering Bootcamp by SheCodeAfrica where i learnt how to deploy applications on Azure Web app service, Docker and Azure Kubernetes(AKS) 
I created a python script for a POS system of a retail organization
This script triggers messages to suppliers and customers when a product is out of stock or restocked.
It scans through the inventory before sending these messages.
